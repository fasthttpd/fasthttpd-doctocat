## Built-in configuration

The following is a minimal configuration built into fasthttpd.

```yaml
host: localhost
listen: ':8080'
root: ./public
log:
  output: stderr

handlers:
  'static':
    type: fs
    indexNames: [index.html]

routes:
  - path: /
    handler: static
```

## Custom configuration

The following is a configuration that uses most of the current FastHttpd features.

```yaml
host: localhost
# NOTE: Define listen addr. It is supported ipv6 `[::1]:8080`
listen: ':8080'
root: ./public

# Define fasthttp.Server settings.
server:
  name: fasthttpd
  readBufferSize: 4096
  writeBufferSize: 4096

---

include: conf.d/*.yaml
```

## Host

```yaml
host: localhost
```

## Listen

Listen represents the IP adress and port.

```yaml
listen: ':8080'
```

## Root

Path to the root directory to serve files from.
`./` indicates the directory where config.yaml is located.

```yaml
root: ./public
```

## Server

Server represents settings for fasthttp.Server.

```yaml
server:
  name: fasthttpd
  readBufferSize: 4096
  writeBufferSize: 4096
  readTimeout: 60s
  writeTimeout: 60s
```

| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| name | Server name for sending in response headers |
| readBufferSize | Per-connection buffer size for requests' reading. This also limits the maximum header size. This also limits the maximum header size. Increase this buffer if your clients send multi-KB RequestURIs and/or multi-KB headers (for example, BIG cookies). Default buffer size is used if not set. |
| writeBufferSize | Per-connection buffer size for responses' writing. Default buffer size is used if not set. |
| readTimeout | The amount of time allowed to read the full request including body. The connection's read deadline is reset when the connection opens, or for keep-alive connections after the first byte has been read. By default request read timeout is unlimited. Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h". |
| writeTimeout | The maximum duration before timing out writes of the response. It is reset after the request handler has returned. By default response write timeout is unlimited. Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h". |

Other string, bool and numbers can be set. See [fashttp/server.go](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp/blob/master/server.go) for details.

## Log

Log represents settings for logging.

```yaml
log:
  output: logs/error.log
  # NOTE: Flags supports date|time|microseconds
  flags: [date, time]
  rotation:
    maxSize: 100
    maxBackups: 14
    maxAge: 28
    compress: true
    localTime: true
```

| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| output | Output file path. `stdout` and `stderr` are special strings that indicate standard output and standard error output, respectively. |
| flags | For example, flags [date, time] produce `2009/01/23 01:23:23 message` |
| rotation.maxSize | The maximum size in megabytes of the log file before it gets rotated. It defaults to 100 megabytes. |
| rotation.maxBackups | The maximum number of days to retain old log files based on the timestamp encoded in their filename.  Note that a day is defined as 24 hours and may not exactly correspond to calendar days due to daylight savings, leap seconds, etc. The default is not to remove old log files based on age.|
| rotation.maxAge | The maximum number of old log files to retain.  The default is to retain all old log files (though MaxAge may still cause them to get deleted.) |
| rotation.compress | Compress determines if the rotated log files should be compressed using gzip. The default is not to perform compression. |
| rotation.localTime | LocalTime determines if the time used for formatting the timestamps in backup files is the computer's local time.  The default is to use UTC time. |

The rotation is based on [natefinch/lumberjack](https://github.com/natefinch/lumberjack).

## AccessLog

AccessLog represents settings for the access logging.

```yaml
accessLog:
  output: logs/access.log

    compress: true
    localTime: true
```

| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| output | Output file path. `stdout` and `stderr` are special strings that indicate standard output and standard error output, respectively. |
| format | The characteristics of the request itself are logged by placing "%" directives in the format string [Apache Custom Log Formats](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/mod/mod_log_config.html) |
| rotation.maxSize | The maximum size in megabytes of the log file before it gets rotated. It defaults to 100 megabytes. |
| rotation.maxBackups | The maximum number of days to retain old log files based on the timestamp encoded in their filename.  Note that a day is defined as 24 hours and may not exactly correspond to calendar days due to daylight savings, leap seconds, etc. The default is not to remove old log files based on age.|
| rotation.maxAge | The maximum number of old log files to retain.  The default is to retain all old log files (though MaxAge may still cause them to get deleted.) |
| rotation.compress | Compress determines if the rotated log files should be compressed using gzip. The default is not to perform compression. |
| rotation.localTime | LocalTime determines if the time used for formatting the timestamps in backup files is the computer's local time.  The default is to use UTC time. |

The rotation is based on [natefinch/lumberjack](https://github.com/natefinch/lumberjack).
