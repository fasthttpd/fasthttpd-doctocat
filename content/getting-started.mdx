This guide will walk you through serving static files. 

## 1. Configuration

The following is a minimal configuration built into fasthttpd.

```yaml
host: localhost
listen: ':8080'
root: ./public
log:
  output: stderr

handlers:
  'static':
    type: fs
    indexNames: [index.html]

routes:
  - path: /
    handler: static
```

## 2. Start fasthttpd

Start fasthttpd with a partial overwrite of the built-in configuration.
Then you can hit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.

```sh
fashttpd -e root=.
```

Or specify your configuration file.

```sh
fashttpd -f config.yaml
```
